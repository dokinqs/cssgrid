# CSS Grid Video Course

Hey! These are the starter files and finished solutions. Grab the full course over at [CSSGrid.io](https://CSSGrid.io).

## Course FAQ

### Q: I'm getting Browsersync Couldn't open browser (if you are using BrowserSync in a headless environment, you might want to set the open option to false)

This is because some versions of Firefox are "FirefoxDeveloperEdition" and some new downloads are "Firefox Developer Edition". If you had downloaded the browser before the course, just remove the spaces from the package.json command so it says "FirefoxDeveloperEdition"

## A note on Pull Requests

These are meant to be 1:1 copies of what is done in the video. If you found a better / different way to do things, great, but I will be keeping them the same as the videos.

The starter files + solutions will be updated if/when the videos are updated.

Thanks!
